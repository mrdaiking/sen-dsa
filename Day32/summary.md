# Day 32 Summary: Diameter of Binary Tree

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- ✅ Implemented DFS recursion with global max tracking
- ✅ Added comprehensive test cases (null, single, balanced, skewed, perfect trees)
- ✅ Analyzed complexity: O(n) time, O(h) space
- ✅ Documented theory and edge cases
- ✅ Verified all test cases pass

## 🔑 Key Learnings
1. **Global Max Tracking**: Essential when diameter may not pass through root
2. **Three Cases Per Node**: Left subtree, right subtree, or through current node
3. **Height vs Diameter**: Return height, but track diameter globally
4. **Post-order Traversal**: Process children before calculating parent values

## 🔗 Pattern Connections
- **From Days 29-31**: Advanced tree recursion patterns
- **New pattern**: Global state tracking in recursion
- **Foundation for**: Tree DP, advanced tree algorithms

## 📈 Progress
- **Week 8 Trees**: 4/4 days completed (100%) ✅
- **Overall DSA**: 32/45 days completed (71%)
- **Confidence**: High - Tree recursion mastered
