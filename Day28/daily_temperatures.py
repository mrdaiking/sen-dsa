Day 28: Daily Temperatures
Pattern: Monotonic Stack (Next Greater Element)

Given an array of temperatures, return an array where answer[i] is the number of days
you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day
for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example:
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

Constraints:
- 1 <= temperatures.length <= 10^5
- 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100
