# Day 3: Array Practice & Review - Consolidation Day

## üéØ Today's Goal
**Strengthen and consolidate array patterns from Days 1-2 through focused practice**

---

## üìö What We've Learned So Far

### Day 1: Big-O & Basic Arrays
- **Two Sum pattern**: HashMap for O(1) lookup
- **Stock problem**: Single pass with tracking min/max
- **Palindrome checking**: Two pointers from ends

### Day 2: Advanced Array Patterns  
- **Three Sum**: Extending Two Sum with sorting + two pointers
- **Product tricks**: Avoiding division with left/right passes
- **In-place operations**: Space optimization techniques

---

## üß† Consolidation Questions (Answer First!)

Before we practice, let's test your pattern mastery:

### 1. Pattern Recognition
**When you see these, what approach do you think of?**
- "Find pair with target sum" ‚Üí ?
- "Find triplet with target sum" ‚Üí ?
- "Array products without division" ‚Üí ? 
- "Check palindrome property" ‚Üí ?

### 2. Complexity Analysis
**What's the time complexity and WHY?**
- Two Sum with HashMap: ?
- Three Sum with sorting: ?
- Two pointers on array: ?

### 3. Trade-off Thinking
**When would you choose:**
- HashMap vs Two Pointers for Two Sum?
- Single pass vs Multiple passes?
- Extra space vs In-place operations?

## üéØ Today's Practice Strategy

**3 Problems** to solidify understanding:

### Problem 1: Review & Strengthen
Pick ONE problem from Day 1-2 that felt challenging
- Re-solve from scratch
- Focus on clean explanation
- Try alternative approach

### Problem 2: Pattern Extension  
Apply learned patterns to similar problem:
- **If comfortable with Two Sum** ‚Üí Try "Two Sum II" (sorted array)
- **If comfortable with Three Sum** ‚Üí Try "3Sum Closest"
- **If comfortable with Stock** ‚Üí Try "Best Time II" (multiple transactions)

### Problem 3: Mixed Pattern Recognition
New problem that combines multiple concepts from Days 1-2

## ‚è∞ Time Management (45 minutes)

- **15 min**: Pattern review questions + Problem 1
- **20 min**: Problem 2 (new variant)
- **10 min**: Problem 3 + consolidation

---

## üéØ Success Criteria for Today

By end of session, you should:
1. **Quickly recognize** when to use HashMap vs Two Pointers
2. **Explain approach** before coding (thinking out loud)
3. **Write cleaner code** with fewer bugs than Day 1-2
4. **Confidently discuss** time/space trade-offs
