pattern: "Sort + Merge Intervals"
difficulty: "Medium"
time_complexity: "O(n log n)"
space_complexity: "O(n)"
key_concepts:
  - "Sort intervals by start"
  - "Compare end points"
  - "Merge overlapping intervals"
approaches:
  - "Sort, then merge in one pass"
edge_cases:
  - "No overlap"
  - "Full overlap"
  - "Same start/end"
  - "Interval contains all others"
interview_tips:
  - "Always sort before merging"
  - "One pass after sort is enough"
  - "Common in scheduling, booking, etc."
