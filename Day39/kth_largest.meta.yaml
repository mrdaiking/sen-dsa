pattern: "Heap / Quickselect"
difficulty: "Medium"
time_complexity: "O(n log k) (heap), O(n) avg (quickselect)"
space_complexity: "O(k) (heap), O(1) (quickselect)"
key_concepts:
  - "Min-Heap (Priority Queue)"
  - "Quickselect (Partition)"
  - "Sorting"
  - "Top-K Pattern"
approaches:
  - "Min-Heap (Recommended for large n, small k)"
  - "Quickselect (Fastest for static array)"
  - "Sorting (Simple, not optimal)"
edge_cases:
  - "k = 1 (max element)"
  - "k = len(nums) (min element)"
  - "Duplicates"
  - "Negative numbers"
  - "Large arrays"
interview_tips:
  - "Heap is best for streaming/online data"
  - "Quickselect is fastest for static arrays"
  - "Sorting is simplest, but not optimal for big data"
  - "Know Python's heapq module"
