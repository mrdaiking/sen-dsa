class BestBuySell:
    """
    You are given an array `prices` where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy the stock and 
    a different day in the future to sell it.

    Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. 
    If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

    Example 1:
    Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
    Note that you cannot sell on day 1 (price = 7) and then buy on day 2 (price = 1).

    Example 2:
    Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
