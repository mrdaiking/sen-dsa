# Day 30 Summary: Same Tree / Invert Tree

## âœ… Completed Tasks
- âœ… Implemented Same Tree with simultaneous recursion
- âœ… Implemented Invert Tree with post-order modification
- âœ… Added comprehensive test cases (empty, same, different values/structure)
- âœ… Verified tree inversion with value checks
- âœ… Analyzed complexity: O(n) time, O(h) space

## ðŸ”‘ Key Learnings
1. **Simultaneous recursion**: Two parallel recursions for tree comparison
2. **Post-order modification**: Process subtrees before modifying current node
3. **In-place swap**: Direct pointer manipulation for tree inversion
4. **Short-circuit evaluation**: AND operator stops early on failure

## ðŸ”— Pattern Connections
- **From Day 29**: Tree recursion fundamentals
- **Dual recursion**: Same Tree extends single recursion to parallel processing
- **Tree modification**: Invert Tree shows how to modify tree structure during traversal

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress
- **Week 8 Trees**: 2/4 days completed (50%)
- **Overall DSA**: 30/45 days completed (67%)
- **Confidence**: High - tree recursion patterns mastered
