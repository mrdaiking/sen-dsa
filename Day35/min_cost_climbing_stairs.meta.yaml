learned_at: "2025-11-19"
approaches:
  - "Bottom-up DP with array"
  - "Space-optimized DP (O(1))"
  - "Top-down DP with memoization"
time_complexity: "O(n)"
space_complexity: "O(1) optimized, O(n) others"
key_insights:
  - "DP state: min cost to reach step i"
  - "Transition: cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2])"
  - "Can start from step 0 or 1"
  - "Can reach top from either n-1 or n-2"
edge_cases:
  - "Empty array: 0"
  - "Single step: 0"
  - "Two steps: min of both"
  - "All zeros: 0"
connections:
  - "Climbing Stairs (count ways instead of min cost)"
  - "House Robber (maximize instead of minimize)"
  - "Frog Jump (similar jump mechanics)"
