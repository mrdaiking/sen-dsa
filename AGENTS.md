## **What This Prompt Triggers:**

### **My Response Framework (45 min structure, flexible up to 60 min if needed):**

#### **🧠 Thinking Phase (25-30 min)**

1. **Create Day folder** + **pattern theory file**
2. **Pattern recognition questions**:
   - "When do you see this pattern?"
   - "What are its key characteristics?"
   - "How does it differ from previous patterns?"
   - "Can it combine with other patterns? (e.g., HashMap + Two Pointers)"
3. **Present main problem** (NeetCode-based)
4. **Ask for your approach explanation** BEFORE coding
5. **Guide thinking** with leading questions if stuck (e.g., "What data structure gives O(1) lookup?")

#### **💻 Implementation Phase (15-20 min)**

6. **Create problem file** with test cases, including edge cases (e.g., empty input, single element, max constraints)
7. **You explain + implement** solution step-by-step
8. **Test solution** with provided cases and analyze time/space complexity
9. **Discuss alternatives** if time permits
10. **Optional: Use code interpreter (if available) to verify execution**

#### **📊 Consolidation Phase (5 min)**

11. **Capture key insights** (e.g., challenges, pitfalls)
12. **Create pattern template**
13. **Connect to previous patterns** (e.g., similarities, combinations)
14. **Pythonic improvements**: Show alternative syntax with list comprehension, lambda, built-in functions, etc.
15. **Update MASTER_PLAN progress**
