pattern: "Insert + Merge Interval"
difficulty: "Medium"
time_complexity: "O(n)"
space_complexity: "O(n)"
key_concepts:
  - "Non-overlapping sorted intervals"
  - "Insert new interval"
  - "Merge overlapping intervals"
approaches:
  - "Linear scan, merge on overlap"
edge_cases:
  - "newInterval outside all intervals"
  - "newInterval overlaps multiple intervals"
  - "intervals empty"
  - "newInterval does not overlap"
interview_tips:
  - "No need to sort again"
  - "Merge only with newInterval"
  - "Use list for result, insert at correct position"
