# Day 2: Array Patterns Deep Dive

## 🎯 **Key Concept**
Advanced array manipulation patterns that go beyond basic traversal.

## 📝 **When to Use**
- Multiple element relationships (pairs, triplets)
- In-place modifications required
- Space optimization needed
- Mathematical operations on arrays

## ⚡ **Complexity Expectations**
- **Time**: O(n) to O(n²) depending on pattern
- **Space**: O(1) for in-place, O(n) for auxiliary arrays

## 🔍 **Core Patterns Today**
1. **Multiple Sum Problems** (extension of Two Sum)
2. **Array Product Tricks** (avoiding division)
3. **In-place Array Manipulation**

## 🎯 **Today's Focus Questions**
- How do we extend Two Sum to Three Sum?
- How can we compute products without division?
- What are the trade-offs between time and space complexity?
